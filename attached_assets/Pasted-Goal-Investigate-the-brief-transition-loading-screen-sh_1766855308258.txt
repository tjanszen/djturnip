Goal: Investigate the brief “transition/loading” screen shown after tapping “Recipe it” (Fridge Cleanout → New Recipe), determine what triggers it, why it exists, and whether we should remove or bypass it (especially for FRIDGE_SINGLE_RECIPE_SCREEN_V1).

Do:
- Reproduce the issue locally:
  - Start at Fridge Cleanout
  - Tap “Recipe it”
  - Observe the brief loading/transition screen (≈ <1s) before landing on “New Recipe”
- Identify the exact screen/component involved:
  - Find which route/screen is rendered during that brief moment
  - Confirm whether it’s a legacy “Processing/Generating/Loading” screen, a suspense fallback, or a state-machine “processing” status
- Trace the navigation and state transitions that cause it:
  - Locate the handler for “Recipe it” CTA
  - Determine if it:
    - navigates to an intermediate route before “New Recipe”, or
    - sets a status like "processing" that conditionally renders a loading UI, or
    - awaits async work (normalization/session init/remote call) before navigation
- Explain why it exists:
  - Document what it was originally for in the old flow (e.g., ingredient normalization, session creation, analytics, prefetch, OpenAI call)
  - Confirm whether any async work still happens there today
- Decide whether it’s needed:
  - If it’s purely cosmetic and no required async work happens, remove it.
  - If there is required async work, evaluate:
    - Can we do it synchronously/instant without a screen?
    - Can we do it in the background after navigating to “New Recipe”?
    - Can we replace it with a non-blocking inline spinner instead of a full-screen transition?
- Implement the minimal change:
  - If FRIDGE_SINGLE_RECIPE_SCREEN_V1 is ON:
    - Prefer navigating directly to the “New Recipe” consolidated screen with no intermediate screen.
    - Keep any required state init, but do it before navigation only if it’s truly necessary.
  - If the flag is OFF:
    - Preserve legacy behavior unless it’s clearly an accidental leftover and safe to remove globally.
- Add debug instrumentation (temporary is fine) to prove the root cause:
  - Log on “Recipe it” press: "cleanout_recipe_it_click"
  - Log the route/screen name shown during the brief transition
  - Log when navigation to “New Recipe” occurs

Do NOT:
- Change generation logic or payloads.
- Add new backend calls.
- Remove any required initialization without proving it’s unnecessary.

Gate via feature flag:
- FRIDGE_SINGLE_RECIPE_SCREEN_V1 = OFF by default.
- Any bypass/removal should be applied at least for the flag ON path.

Proof:
- Before/after behavior documented:
  - Identify the transition screen component/route and why it appears.
  - Confirm whether any async work depends on it.
- With FRIDGE_SINGLE_RECIPE_SCREEN_V1 ON:
  - Tapping “Recipe it” goes directly to “New Recipe” with no intermediate full-screen loading flash.
- With FRIDGE_SINGLE_RECIPE_SCREEN_V1 OFF:
  - Legacy flow remains unchanged (unless the transition was proven redundant and safely removed globally).
- Logs clearly show:
  - Click → (optional init) → direct navigati
