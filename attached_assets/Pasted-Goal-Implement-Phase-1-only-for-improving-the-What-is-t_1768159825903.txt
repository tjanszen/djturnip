Goal: Implement **Phase 1 only** for improving the “What is this?” and “Why this works” copy style, as defined in  
`docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/updated_what_is_this_011126.md`.

Phase 1 introduces **actual prompt text changes** to the V2 LLM prompt.  
This phase updates *only* copy-generation behavior. No schema, validation, backend routing, or frontend changes are allowed.

---

Do:
1) Read the implementation plan at:
   - `docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/updated_what_is_this_011126.md`

   Pay close attention to:
   - The semantic split between the two sections
   - Tone goals: smart-simple, tweet-length, plain language
   - Anti-duplication intent
   - “Vary phrasing” guidance for customizability

2) Update the **V2 SYSTEM prompt text** in:
   - `server/prompts/urlRemixV2.ts`

   Apply the following changes **only to prompt wording**:

---

### Update: `what_is_this`

Replace the existing guidance with instructions that enforce:

- Length: **1–2 sentences max (tweet-length)**
- Tone: friendly, plain language, readable by non-foodies
- MUST cover:
  - What kind of dish this is
  - What it’s usually made from (everyday words only)
  - Why it’s easy to change or make your own
- MUST NOT cover:
  - Why it tastes good
  - Texture or flavor payoff
  - Cooking techniques, steps, or tools
- Language constraints:
  - Avoid jargon (acid, legume, umami, aromatics, emulsify)
  - If a concept is needed, explain it in simple terms
- Add instruction:
  - When explaining customization, **vary phrasing by dish type**
    (e.g., absorbs flavor, pairs with toppings, works with what you have)

---

### Update: top-level `why_this_works`

Replace the existing guidance with instructions that enforce:

- Length: **1–2 sentences max (tweet-length)**
- Tone: simple, conversational, not academic
- MUST cover:
  - Why the textures and flavors are satisfying
  - Why people keep making this type of dish
- MUST NOT cover:
  - Defining the dish
  - Listing ingredients
  - Talking about customization or flexibility
- Focus on:
  - Comfort
  - Contrast (soft/crunchy, rich/fresh)
  - Slow payoff, balance, or familiarity
- Use plain cause-and-effect language, no jargon

---

3) Preserve all existing V2 constraints and structure:
   - Single LLM call
   - Same JSON shape
   - Same field names
   - Same validation behavior
   - Same retry + V1 fallback logic
   - No changes to per-variation `why_this_works` in this phase

4) Do NOT modify:
   - Zod schemas
   - Response contracts
   - Frontend rendering
   - Telemetry
   - Feature flags

---

Verification:
- Run at least 3 known recipe URLs through `/api/recipes/process` with `ALT_RECIPES_V2=on`
- Confirm:
  - `what_is_this` reads like a smart tweet and includes flexibility without jargon
  - `why_this_works` explains payoff without redefining the dish
  - The two sections do not repeat the same idea
  - V2 validation succeeds on first attempt (no fallback)

---

Out of Scope:
- No UI changes
- No layout changes
- No schema or validation changes
- No analytics updates
- No new fields

---

Proof:
- Prompt text reflects the copy contract documented in  
  `docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/updated_what_is_this_011126.md`
- Behavior changes are limited strictly to generated copy quality.
- Application compiles and runs with no structural changes.
