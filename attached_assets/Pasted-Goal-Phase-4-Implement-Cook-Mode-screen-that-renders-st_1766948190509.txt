Goal: Phase 4 — Implement Cook Mode screen that renders step-by-step instructions using RecipeDTO V2, correctly reflecting ingredient substitutions via ID-based mapping, without changing generation or substitution logic.

Do:
- Confirm feature flag RECIPE_DETAIL_V2 exists and is OFF by default.
- Create a new Cook Mode screen/page that is only reachable when RECIPE_DETAIL_V2 is ON.
- Navigation:
  - From the Recipe Summary screen, wire the primary CTA “Let’s Cook!” to navigate to Cook Mode.
  - Back arrow in Cook Mode must return to Recipe Summary (not New Recipe).
- Data handling:
  - Cook Mode consumes:
    - The original RecipeDTO V2
    - The current “working copy” of ingredients from Recipe Summary (including any substitutions)
  - Do NOT mutate the original RecipeDTO.
- Step rendering:
  - Render steps from RecipeDTO.steps (array of StepItem).
  - For each step:
    - Display numbered order (1, 2, 3, …).
    - Render StepItem.text as the base instruction.
    - Append time estimate if present:
      - Format: “~<n> minutes”
      - Use StepItem.time_minutes (minutes only).
  - Ingredient substitution handling (critical):
    - Use StepItem.ingredient_ids to determine which ingredients are referenced in the step.
    - When rendering, map ingredient_ids to the current working-copy ingredients:
      - If an ingredient was substituted, use the substituted name + amount.
      - If not substituted, use the original name + amount.
    - Do NOT use string replacement on step text.
    - Assume step text already includes ingredient amounts in parentheses; the mapping ensures correctness.
- Layout:
  - Focused, readable, scrollable steps view.
  - Steps are the primary content (no ingredients list here).
- Bottom CTAs:
  - Render two CTAs fixed near bottom (or at end of content):
    - “Favorite” (placeholder, no-op)
    - “Done” (placeholder, no-op)
- State rules:
  - Ingredient substitutions made in Recipe Summary must be reflected here.
  - Generate Again and Edit Ingredients are NOT available in Cook Mode.
- Error handling:
  - If steps array is empty or malformed, show a simple error state (“Unable to load steps”) with Back action.

Constraints:
- Do NOT trigger generation or regeneration in Cook Mode.
- Do NOT allow ingredient editing or substitution from Cook Mode.
- Do NOT change RecipeDTO V2 schema.
- Do NOT affect legacy behavior when RECIPE_DETAIL_V2 is OFF.

Gate via feature flag:
- RECIPE_DETAIL_V2 = OFF by default.

Proof:
- With RECIPE_DETAIL_V2 ON:
  - Tapping “Let’s Cook!” navigates to Cook Mode.
  - Steps render numbered with time estimates in minutes.
  - Ingredient substitutions made in Recipe Summary are correctly reflected in steps.
  - Back arrow returns to Recipe Summary.
  - “Favorite” and “Done” buttons render and do nothing.
- With RECIPE_DETAIL_V2 OFF:
  - Cook Mode is unreachable and legacy recipe result screen remains unchanged.
- No backend calls or generation logic runs when entering Cook Mode.
