Goal: Update the Recipe Detail Page ("fridge-result" view) UX/UI to a clean, full-width layout (no centered card), with new section order and simplified interactions.

Do:
- Locate the Recipe Detail Page component/view ("fridge-result") and update the layout to remove the current card/container styling:
  - Remove bg-card/border/shadow/rounded-2xl “card in the middle” look.
  - Remove max-w centered container behavior.
  - Use a full-width, mobile-first vertical layout with minimal horizontal padding only for text sections (hero image should be edge-to-edge or near edge-to-edge).

- Update visual hierarchy and section order to exactly:
  1) Hero Image (top)
  2) Metadata row: Servings | Time | Calories (if present)
  3) Short Description (recipe.description)
  4) Ingredients list
  5) Primary CTA: “Let’s Cook!”
  6) Secondary CTA: “Remix Recipe” (replaces “Generate again”)

- Header:
  - Keep back arrow in upper-left (ghost/icon-only) with existing testid: data-testid="button-result-back"
  - Remove any trash/delete icon in upper-right (do not render it).
  - Title should remain near the top and readable (keep existing data-testid="text-recipe-name").
  - You can keep title above the hero image or overlay on top of the image, but do NOT reintroduce a card container. Prefer title/description above image only if it stays clean.

- Hero Image:
  - Keep existing async image generation via POST /api/recipes/generate-image and existing client-side caching by recipe hash (do not change endpoint behavior).
  - Replace the skeleton placeholder only if needed later; for now keep current loading skeleton (no extra work in this prompt unless required by layout).
  - Change aspect ratio from aspect-square to a clean full-width hero ratio similar to modern recipe apps:
    - Use 4:3 or 16:9 (choose one and implement consistently; prefer 4:3 for food).
  - Keep object-cover and smooth corners if desired, but avoid “card inset”; image should feel like part of the page, not inside a padded card.

- Metadata row:
  - Keep the 3 badges (servings, time, calories optional) in a single row under the image.
  - Ensure the row uses the full width and wraps nicely on small screens.

- Remove “Why this works” from UI:
  - Do NOT render the explanation section at all (remove heading + body).
  - Keep the `explanation` field in the RecipeDTO / JSON unchanged (no backend changes).

- Ingredients section:
  - Render a simple, non-interactive list of ingredients (name left, amount right).
  - Remove ALL substitution functionality:
    - Remove chevrons
    - Remove tappable rows
    - Remove Drawer/Bottom sheet
    - Remove “working copy” substitution state
    - Remove any “Swap ingredient” UI strings
  - “Generate Again” / “Remix Recipe” should always use the original recipe inputs as before (but since substitutions are removed, there should be no working copy anyway).

- Action buttons:
  - Keep “Let’s Cook!” as primary (existing data-testid="button-lets-cook") and keep navigation to Cook Mode unchanged.
  - Replace “Generate again” button with “Remix Recipe”:
    - Keep same behavior: trigger a new recipe generation with the same inputs as today.
    - Update testid to data-testid="button-remix-recipe" (or keep the old testid if changing it would break tests; if tests exist, update them accordingly).
    - Update telemetry event name from generate_again_click to remix_recipe_click if telemetry is wired in this component; otherwise keep existing event but change label text only (pick the smallest change that matches existing telemetry patterns).
  - Remove the “Edit Ingredients” link entirely (do not render it).

- Keep all other behavior unchanged:
  - Recipe generation flow
  - Cuisine logic
  - DTO fields and parsing
  - Cook mode screen

Do NOT:
- Add new feature flags
- Change backend schemas/prompts
- Add new endpoints
- Rework image generation integration beyond aspect ratio/layout
- Modify cook mode

Proof:
- Logs must still include: "recipe_image_gen_success recipeKey=<hash>" when image loads.
- Back button works and returns to ingredient input screen (and clears any now-removed substitution state without errors).
- Recipe detail page shows: Image → badges → description → ingredients → Let’s Cook → Remix Recipe.
- “Why this works” is not visible anywhere on the page.
- No substitution drawer exists and ingredient rows are not tappable.
- No “Edit Ingredients” UI exists.
- “Remix Recipe” triggers a new recipe + new hero image generation (new recipeKey) without crashing.
