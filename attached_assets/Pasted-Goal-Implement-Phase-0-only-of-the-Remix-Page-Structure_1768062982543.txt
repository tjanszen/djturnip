Goal: Implement **Phase 0 only** of the Remix Page Structure VNext, as defined in  
`docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/remix_page_1_10_26.md`.

Phase 0 is a **non-functional alignment phase**. The purpose is to lock down state strategy, naming, and guardrails before any backend or UI changes occur. No user-visible behavior should change in this phase.

---

Do:
1) Read and understand the implementation plan at:
   - `docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/remix_page_1_10_26.md`
   Focus specifically on:
   - The “Phase 0 — Response Model + State Strategy” section
   - The notes about carefully renaming `viewState` due to shared usage with Fridge Cleanout

2) Audit current routing and state usage related to remix results:
   - Identify all places where `viewState === "swiping"` is used.
   - Confirm which branches correspond to:
     - URL Remix results
     - Fridge Cleanout results
   - Document (in code comments) how `recipeMode` or equivalent flags currently differentiate these flows.

3) Prepare for the new state without breaking Fridge Cleanout:
   - Introduce awareness (comments and/or TODOs) that:
     - URL Remix results will move to `viewState === "remix-result"`
     - Fridge Cleanout will continue using its existing state (`"swiping"` or equivalent)
   - Do NOT rename or change behavior yet.
   - Do NOT update conditional rendering logic yet.

4) Add explicit guardrail comments in the Home/results rendering logic:
   - Reference `docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/remix_page_1_10_26.md`
   - Clearly state:
     - Why `swiping` cannot be globally renamed
     - That Phase 1+ will introduce `remix-result` for URL Remix only
     - That Fridge Cleanout behavior must remain untouched

5) Optional (recommended):
   - Add a short TODO block noting:
     - “Phase 1 will extend the V2 response contract”
     - “Phase 2 will update prompts and UI”
   - This is for reviewer clarity only.

Out of Scope for Phase 0:
- No backend changes
- No prompt changes
- No schema/Zod changes
- No UI or layout changes
- No renaming of `viewState` values
- No feature flag changes

---

Proof:
- Code contains clear comments documenting:
  - Shared use of `viewState === "swiping"`
  - Planned introduction of `viewState === "remix-result"` for URL Remix only
- Comments explicitly reference:
  - `docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/remix_page_1_10_26.md`
- Application behavior is identical before and after Phase 0.
- Phase 0 creates shared understanding and prevents accidental regressions.
