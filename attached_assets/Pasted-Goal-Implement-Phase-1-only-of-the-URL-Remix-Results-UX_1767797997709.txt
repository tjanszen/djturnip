Goal: Implement **Phase 1 only** of the URL Remix Results UX refactor, as defined in  
`docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/remix_result_layout.md`.

Phase 1 focuses on **backend response shaping only** to ensure the frontend has the data required to render the Fridge Cleanout–style results layout. No UI changes should occur in this phase.

---

Do:
1) Read and understand the implementation plan at:
   - `docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/remix_result_layout.md`
   Focus specifically on:
   - “Phase 1 — Backend Response Shaping (No Visual Impact)”
   - The requirement that the URL Remix results screen can render:
     - Recipe title
     - Original ingredient list
     - Remix cards

2) Update the **URL Remix V2 backend response** (only the V2 path) to include the original ingredient lines:
   - Ensure the response includes:
     - `extractedRecipe.title: string`
     - `extractedRecipe.ingredients: string[]`
   - Ingredients should be returned as **raw strings** (no parsing, no normalization, no swapping metadata).

3) Preserve all existing behavior and contracts:
   - Do NOT add a description field.
   - Do NOT modify `alternatives[]` structure or ordering.
   - Do NOT change validation, retry, or fallback logic.
   - Do NOT affect Fridge Cleanout or V1 remix flows.

4) Keep failure behavior unchanged:
   - Extraction failure → 422
   - Generation/parse failure → existing handling (including V1 fallback if applicable)

5) Add minimal safety checks:
   - If extracted ingredients are unexpectedly missing or empty, return them as an empty array rather than throwing.
   - Do not introduce new error states in this phase.

Out of Scope for Phase 1:
- Any frontend or layout work
- Any component extraction
- Any ingredient parsing or `{name, amount}` shaping
- Any description generation
- Any UX or styling changes

---

Proof:
- With a valid recipe URL and `ALT_RECIPES_V2=on`, the API response includes:
  - `extractedRecipe.title`
  - `extractedRecipe.ingredients` as an array of strings
- Existing consumers (including Fridge Cleanout) are unaffected.
- UI renders exactly the same as before this phase.
- Phase 1 strictly enables future UI work; it does not change UX.

This phase should be small, safe, and reviewable in isolation.
