Goal: Implement **Phase 2b only** of Remix Page Structure VNext, per  
`docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/remix_page_1_10_26.md`.

Phase 2b updates the **frontend results layout** for URL Remix V2 to the new section structure and introduces `viewState="remix-result"` for URL Remix only, while ensuring Fridge Cleanout remains unaffected (it may still use `viewState="swiping"` with recipeMode gating).

Do:
1) Read and follow:
   - `docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/remix_page_1_10_26.md`
   Focus on:
   - Phase 2b (frontend layout + section rendering)
   - The warning that `viewState === "swiping"` is shared across URL Remix and Fridge Cleanout

2) Update state transitions carefully (avoid breaking Fridge Cleanout):
   - Introduce `viewState = "remix-result"` for the URL Remix success path only.
   - Do NOT globally rename `"swiping"` if Fridge Cleanout depends on it.
   - Confirm Fridge Cleanout result rendering continues to work as-is (likely still using `"swiping"` + recipeMode).
   - Ensure browser/app Back returns to the input view (current behavior).

3) Render the new Remix Result page structure (URL Remix V2 only)
   When `viewState === "remix-result"` and V2 response data is present, render sections in this exact order:

   A) Title
      - Compose in frontend: "{recipeTitle} + {alternatives.length} Chef tips to make it better"
      - Always use "Chef tips" (no pluralization logic).

   B) What is this
      - Render `what_is_this` (1–2 sentences)

   C) Why this works
      - Render `why_this_works` (1–2 sentences)

   D) Ingredients (collapsed by default)
      - Accordion header row labeled "Ingredients" with a chevron
      - Default collapsed
      - Expand shows extractedRecipe.ingredients (read-only list)
      - Keep Fridge Cleanout styling for ingredient rows, but no swap UI.

   E) Creative Variations
      - Render all 9 alternatives in the existing card style (non-interactive)
      - Each card shows:
        - title
        - per-variation `why_this_works` (1 sentence) ABOVE the changes list
        - changes list (action + details)

   F) CTA: "Remix your own recipes"
      - Placeholder button, no-op (no navigation, no handler side effects)

   G) FAQ
      - Placeholder accordion UI but disabled (no answers, no expansion behavior)
      - Display the 4 questions:
        - Can I swap ingredient x?
        - Can I reduce fat?
        - Can I increase protein?
        - Can I make this vegan?

   H) You might also like
      - Render header + subsection headers only:
        - Similar dishes
        - Similar problems
        - Similar transitions
      - No items required.

4) Keep error + loading behavior consistent with current approach
   - Preserve current submit loading (spinner/disabled button) behavior.
   - On request failure (422/502/etc.), stay on input view and show inline error.
   - Do NOT render partial results: only show remix-result if the API call returned a valid V2 payload.

5) Ensure existing URL Remix UI elements do not appear on remix-result
   - Do not show swipe UI / skip-save controls / success toast in remix-result.
   - (If a success toast exists, do not address it here unless it blocks UX; it can be handled in a dedicated cleanup phase.)

Out of Scope:
- No backend changes
- No prompt changes
- No schema changes
- No deep-linking / new routes (keep SPA viewState model)
- No making CTA functional
- No adding content to “You might also like”

Proof:
- With ALT_RECIPES_V2=on and a valid URL:
  - The app transitions to viewState="remix-result"
  - The page renders the new section order and uses new V2 fields
  - Ingredients are collapsed by default and expandable
  - Each variation card shows per-variation why_this_works above changes[]
  - Back returns to the URL input view
- Fridge Cleanout results still work exactly as before.
