Goal: Phase 5 — Wire “Allow other ingredients?” toggle + bottom “Create my recipe” CTA on the consolidated screen, ensuring payload parity with the legacy Confirm Ingredients flow.

Do:
- Update toggle copy on consolidated screen to exactly: “Allow other ingredients?”
  - Optional helper text: “Recipe may include common pantry items”
- Bind the toggle to the existing allow_extras (or equivalent) boolean used in the legacy Confirm screen:
  - Default value must remain identical to legacy (typically OFF).
  - Toggling must update the same source of truth (no duplicate state).
- Wire the bottom primary CTA:
  - Text: “Create my recipe”
  - Calls the exact same generate action/function used by the legacy Confirm screen.
  - Uses the same payload builder (or results in an identical request payload).
- Add guardrails:
  - Disable CTA if ingredient list is empty.
  - Disable CTA while generating (prevent double submits).
  - Show existing loading state behavior (spinner/disabled) consistent with legacy confirm->generate.
- Add minimal telemetry/logging:
  - On toggle change: "single_screen_v1 allow_other_ingredients=<true|false>"
  - On CTA press: "single_screen_v1 generate_click"
  - On generate resolution: "single_screen_v1 generate_success=<true|false>"

Constraints:
- Do NOT modify backend endpoints, prompt text, schema, or generation logic.
- Do NOT change the payload shape or field names.
- Do NOT alter legacy Confirm screen behavior; consolidated screen must reuse the same generate pathway.
- Keep FRIDGE_SINGLE_RECIPE_SCREEN_V1 gating intact (OFF by default).

Gate via feature flag:
- FRIDGE_SINGLE_RECIPE_SCREEN_V1 = OFF by default.

Proof:
- Flag ON:
  - Toggle is labeled “Allow other ingredients?” and updates the same allow_extras boolean used by legacy Confirm.
  - CTA “Create my recipe” triggers the same generate call path as legacy Confirm.
  - CTA is disabled when ingredient list empty and during in-flight generate.
  - No double-submit possible.
- Payload parity:
  - In dev logs, print payload from legacy Confirm path and consolidated path and confirm they match (same fields/values).
- Flag OFF:
  - Legacy 2-step flow remains unchanged and still generates successfully.
