Goal: Replace the plain “Generating Recipe” loading screen with a playful, animated, Crumb-style generation screen that feels delightful while preserving generation logic and timing.

Do:
- Identify the current “Generating Recipe” / loading screen shown after “Create my recipe” is tapped.
- Replace its UI (when FRIDGE_SINGLE_RECIPE_SCREEN_V1 is ON) with a new playful generation screen that includes:
  - A friendly illustrated character (e.g., a vegetable mascot like broccoli or a generic food character).
  - Simple looping animation:
    - Character gently bouncing / breathing / swaying.
    - Ingredients (icons or shapes) orbiting, floating, or juggling around the character.
  - Friendly copy text:
    - Primary: “Crafting your recipe…” (or similar)
    - Secondary (optional): “Creating something delicious with your ingredients…”
- Keep animation lightweight:
  - Use simple transforms (translate/rotate/opacity) or Lottie if already supported.
  - Loop indefinitely until generation resolves.
- Maintain full-screen focus:
  - Centered character + text.
  - Soft background color consistent with app theme (cream / warm neutral).
- Include a bottom “Cancel” button (if one exists today):
  - Cancels generation using existing cancel/back behavior.
  - Styling should be calm and secondary (not destructive).

Do NOT:
- Change generation timing, retries, or API logic.
- Delay generation artificially.
- Add new backend calls.
- Block cancellation if it already exists.

Behavior requirements:
- Screen appears immediately after “Create my recipe” tap.
- Screen stays visible until:
  - Generation succeeds → transition to Recipe Result screen.
  - Generation errors → transition to existing error handling.
  - User taps Cancel → return to consolidated “New Recipe” screen.

Gate via feature flag:
- FRIDGE_SINGLE_RECIPE_SCREEN_V1 = OFF by default.
- Only replace loading screen when flag is ON.

Proof:
- With FRIDGE_SINGLE_RECIPE_SCREEN_V1 ON:
  - Tapping “Create my recipe” shows animated, playful generation screen.
  - Animation loops smoothly with no flicker.
  - Cancel button works and returns user to consolidated “New Recipe” screen.
  - Successful generation transitions cleanly to recipe result.
- With flag OFF:
  - Existing “Generating Recipe” screen remains unchanged.
- No changes observed in request payloads or generation success rate.
