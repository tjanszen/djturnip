Goal: Implement **Phase 0 only** for improving the “What is this?” and “Why this works” copy style, as defined in  
`docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/updated_what_is_this_011126.md`.

Phase 0 is a **semantic alignment + documentation phase only**.  
No prompt text should be changed yet. No backend, validation, or UI behavior should change in this phase.

---

Do:
1) Read the implementation plan at:
   - `docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/updated_what_is_this_011126.md`

   Focus specifically on:
   - The intended tone (“smart-simple”, tweet-length)
   - The semantic split between:
     - “What is this?” (identity + flexibility)
     - “Why this works” (flavor/texture payoff + why it stuck around)
   - The requirement to avoid foodie jargon and recipe summaries

2) Audit the current V2 prompt instructions related to:
   - `what_is_this`
   - top-level `why_this_works`

   Do NOT change them yet. Instead:
   - Add clear comments near the prompt definition explaining:
     - The distinct responsibility of each section
     - That overlap should be complementary, not duplicative
     - That these sections are intentionally short, plain-language, and non-technical

3) Add explicit “copy contract” comments in the prompt file (e.g., `server/prompts/urlRemixV2.ts`):
   - Document that:
     - “What is this?” answers: *What kind of food is this and why is it flexible?*
     - “Why this works” answers: *Why do people love this and keep making it?*
   - Reference the implementation plan file directly in comments:
     - `docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/updated_what_is_this_011126.md`

4) (Optional but recommended)
   - Add TODO comments marking where Phase 1 will:
     - Introduce tweet-length constraints
     - Add plain-language guardrails
     - Add anti-duplication instructions
   - These are notes for future phases only.

Out of Scope for Phase 0:
- No changes to prompt wording
- No schema or Zod validation changes
- No backend response changes
- No frontend changes
- No telemetry changes

---

Proof:
- Code compiles with no behavior changes.
- Prompt files include clear comments documenting the semantic split and tone goals.
- Comments explicitly reference:
  - `docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/updated_what_is_this_011126.md`
- Phase 0 establishes shared understanding and prevents accidental prompt drift in later phases.
