Goal: Investigate why the URL Remix “results” layout does NOT visually match the Fridge Cleanout results layout, and implement the smallest fix to make them match.

Context:
- We extracted/shared layout work per `docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/remix_result_layout.md`.
- The URL Remix results screen should reuse the same Fridge Cleanout layout and styling (editorial title, section headers, ingredient rows, remix cards).
- However, the current URL Remix results view looks different (spacing/typography/row affordances/cards).

Do:
1) Identify the exact components used in each flow
   - Find the Fridge Cleanout results screen component tree (the screen that shows title + ingredients + remix cards).
   - Find the URL Remix results screen component tree.
   - Confirm whether both screens actually render the SAME shared component (e.g., `RecipeResultsLayout`) and the same child components (ingredient rows, remix cards).
   - Output a short diff list:
     - “Fridge uses: <component A/B/C>”
     - “URL Remix uses: <component X/Y/Z>”
     - “Mismatch: <where it diverges>”

2) Verify shared layout is truly shared (common failure modes)
   Check for these common reasons they don’t match:
   - URL Remix is using a “similar” layout component, not the exact Fridge Cleanout one
   - Different wrapper containers (padding/maxWidth/background) around the shared layout
   - Different typography tokens/classes applied to title/headers
   - Ingredient list is using a simplified list (missing the Fridge row component styles)
   - Remix cards are using a different Card component or different variant props
   - A “readOnly” mode unintentionally swaps to different subcomponents/styles instead of disabling interactions only

3) Proposed fix (smallest change)
   Implement the smallest fix that ensures:
   - URL Remix results renders the exact same:
     - layout wrapper (container/padding)
     - title typography
     - section header typography
     - ingredient row component styling
     - remix card component styling
   - Read-only mode should ONLY remove interactivity:
     - remove chevrons / dropdowns / click handlers
     - remove hover/active styles if they imply tap
     - but KEEP the exact same spacing, fonts, borders, and dividers as Fridge Cleanout

   Concretely:
   - If URL Remix is not using the same shared component, change it to use the exact Fridge component tree.
   - If `mode="readOnly"` is branching to different visual components, refactor so it renders the SAME components and only toggles:
     - `onClick` handlers
     - `showChevron` / `enableSwap` booleans
     - `interactive` CSS classes

4) Add a side-by-side dev verification
   - Add a quick dev-only route or Storybook-style render (whatever your setup supports) that renders:
     - Fridge Cleanout results with a fixture payload
     - URL Remix results with a fixture payload
     - both inside the same parent container
   - This is only to visually confirm they match; do not ship a new UX feature.
   - If you can’t add a route, at minimum add screenshots to the PR description.

Gate via feature flag:
- Do not change any feature flag defaults. Keep current gating as-is.

Proof:
- With the same fixture data (title, ingredients, 9 remix cards), Fridge Cleanout results and URL Remix results are visually indistinguishable except for the intended read-only differences (no chevrons, no dropdowns, no tap affordances).
- Container padding, typography scale, section spacing, and card styling match 1:1.
- No regressions to Fridge Cleanout interactions.
