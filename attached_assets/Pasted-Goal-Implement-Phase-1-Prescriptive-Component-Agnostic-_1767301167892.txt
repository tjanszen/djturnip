Goal:
Implement Phase 1 — Prescriptive Component-Agnostic Flavor Framework,
per docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/flavor-completeness-framework.md (Phase 1).

Snapshot:
- Phase 0 is complete; fixtures exist and baseline outputs were reviewed.
- Recipe generation prompt is assembled in:
  server/routes.ts → /api/recipes/generate-single
- PROMPT_V3_HOMECOOK is a text block used when PROMPT_V3_HOMECOOK=on.
- This phase is PROMPT-ONLY.

Do:
1) Locate the existing PROMPT_V3_HOMECOOK guidance text.
2) Replace ONLY the guidance section with the following concise bullet rules:

   ---
   You are an experienced, thoughtful home-cook assistant.

   Requirements:
   - Keep recipes familiar, achievable, and balanced; avoid novelty for its own sake.
   - Think in components: protein, vegetable, starch, sauce, topping (as applicable).
   - Flavor axes: aromatics; seasoning beyond salt; acid or umami; fat or richness; texture contrast.
   - Each major component should intentionally hit at least 2 flavor axes.
   - Prefer transformative cooking actions over simple mixing or warming
     (e.g. sear, roast, char, bloom spices, deglaze, reduce, blend/emulsify).
   - Cooking steps should include at least one transformative verb for the main component.
   - Mild or creamy components should include contrast (acid, crunch, heat, or char).
   - Use pantry staples freely for depth and balance.
   - Include one clever but intuitive twist that feels obvious in hindsight.
   ---

3) Preserve ALL existing non-flavor requirements exactly as-is, including:
   - JSON schema and required fields
   - Step ID requirements
   - Remix rules and limits
   - Image prompt rules
   - Validation expectations

4) Add the following console log at the point where this prompt variant is used:
   console.log("prompt_v3_flavor_axes_v1_active");

Do NOT:
- Add or modify schema fields
- Add retries, linting, or self-critique loops
- Change model, temperature, or token limits
- Modify remix behavior or counts
- Add scoring, evaluation, or commentary
- Expand guidance beyond the bullets above

Gate via feature flag:
PROMPT_V3_HOMECOOK_FLAVOR_AXES_V1 = on
(prompt version tag only; no runtime behavior change)

Proof:
- Re-run Phase 0 fixtures (must include: dairy-heavy, mild protein, bland starch).
- Previously weak cases show improved balance and transformative actions.
- Recipes remain schema-valid.
- No noticeable increase in verbosity or novelty.

Verification:
- Diff confirms only PROMPT_V3_HOMECOOK text changed.
- Console shows "prompt_v3_flavor_axes_v1_active" when prompt is active.
