Goal: Remove the “Recipe Processed” success toast from the URL Remix UX so the transition to results feels calm and uninterrupted.

Context:
- After a successful URL Remix request, the UI currently shows a toast:
  - Title: “Recipe Processed”
  - Message: “Recipe URL processed with V2 alternatives.”
- This toast appears on top of the results screen and competes visually with the recipe title.
- Per the UX direction in `docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/remix_result_layout.md`, the URL Remix results experience should feel editorial, quiet, and read-first, with no celebratory or system-level success messaging.

Do:
1) Locate where the success toast is triggered after URL Remix completes:
   - This may be:
     - A generic success handler for `/api/recipes/process`
     - A shared toast utility invoked on 200 responses
     - A side effect in the URL Remix submit handler
2) Confirm whether this toast is:
   - Specific to the URL Remix flow, or
   - A generic “success” toast reused elsewhere
3) Remove or suppress the toast **only for the URL Remix success path**:
   - Do NOT remove error toasts or inline error messaging
   - Do NOT affect other flows (e.g., Fridge Cleanout, saves, failures)
   - If the toast utility supports conditional flags (e.g., `showSuccessToast`), use that
   - Otherwise, guard the toast trigger with a check like:
     - “if this is URL Remix success → do not show toast”
4) Ensure no replacement success UI is added:
   - No banners
   - No alerts
   - No confirmation messages
   - Success should be communicated implicitly by rendering the results screen

Out of Scope:
- Changing loading or error behavior
- Adding new UX affordances
- Modifying backend responses
- Removing toasts globally across the app

Proof:
- On successful URL Remix:
  - No “Recipe Processed” (or similar) toast appears
  - The results screen renders directly with title, ingredients, and remix cards
- Error cases still surface errors appropriately (inline or toast, unchanged)
- Other parts of the app that rely on success toasts remain unaffected

This change should make the transition from input → results feel intentional and distraction-free, consistent with the editorial layout defined in `remix_result_layout.md`.
