Goal: Implement **Phase 1 only** of the Remix Page Structure VNext, as defined in  
`docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/remix_page_1_10_26.md`.

Phase 1 is **backend contract extension + strict validation updates** for URL Remix **V2 only**. No frontend/layout changes in this phase.

---

Do:
1) Read and understand the implementation plan at:
   - `docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/remix_page_1_10_26.md`
   Focus specifically on:
   - “Phase 1 — Backend Contract Extension (V2 Only, Strict)”
   - The required new fields and the “no partial render” error-handling policy

2) Extend the **V2 response payload** (ALT_RECIPES_V2 path only) to include new top-level fields:
   - `what_is_this: string` (required; 1–2 sentences target)
   - `why_this_works: string` (required; 1–2 sentences target)

3) Extend each V2 alternative object to include:
   - `why_this_works: string` (required; **one sentence max**, mechanism-based)
   Notes:
   - Keep existing fields unchanged (`kind`, `title`, `changes[]`)
   - Do not reorder fields yet unless it’s required for types—ordering guidance is Phase 2a prompt work.

4) Update strict validation (Zod) in:
   - `server/validation/urlRemixV2.zod.ts`
   to enforce:
   - `what_is_this` is present and non-empty
   - `why_this_works` is present and non-empty
   - each alternative includes `why_this_works` present and non-empty
   - keep all existing validations:
     - exactly 9 alternatives
     - 5 basic + 4 delight
     - unique titles
     - `changes.length` in {2,3}
     - specificity guardrail regex for `details`
     - max 1 retry + fallback to V1 on persistent failure

5) Error handling policy (important)
   - Ensure Phase 1 changes do NOT allow partial success:
     - If the new fields fail validation, treat it as a V2 validation failure:
       - trigger the existing retry flow
       - if still invalid, trigger the existing V1 fallback
   - Do not return a response missing the new fields on the V2 success path.

6) Telemetry/logging updates (minimal)
   - Ensure existing V2 validation telemetry captures failures related to the new fields.
   - If you have structured issue logging (first 5 issues), confirm missing/empty `what_is_this` and `why_this_works` show up clearly.
   - Do not add new event families unless needed.

Out of Scope for Phase 1:
- No prompt changes (Phase 2a)
- No UI/layout changes (Phase 2b+)
- No viewState rename
- No ingredients collapse UX changes
- No CTA/FAQ rendering changes

---

Proof:
- With `ALT_RECIPES_V2=on`, a successful response includes:
  - `what_is_this`
  - `why_this_works`
  - each alternative includes `why_this_works`
- If the model output omits any of these fields:
  - it triggers validation failure → retry once → fallback to V1 if still invalid
- V1 behavior remains unchanged.
- No frontend behavior changes in this phase.
