Goal: Phase 4 — Implement Ingredients editing in the consolidated screen using Crumb-style list rows (subtle background + right trash), plus “+ Add more” button that expands an inline input row. Reuse existing add/remove/normalize logic; do not change payload/generation.

Do:
- Wire the Ingredients section to the existing ingredient list used by the legacy Confirm Ingredients screen (same source of truth).
- Replace chip rendering with Crumb-style list rows:
  - Each ingredient renders in a full-width rounded row with subtle background.
  - Right-aligned trash icon button removes that ingredient.
  - Trash calls the existing remove handler/dispatch (do not reimplement removal logic).
- Implement “+ Add more” button behavior:
  - On press, expand an inline “add ingredient” input row directly under the Ingredients header (or as the first row above the list).
  - Input placeholder: “Add ingredient (e.g. 1 tbsp soy sauce)”
  - Include an “Add” button on the right; Enter/Return also submits.
  - After successful add: clear input, collapse input row (optional), and scroll to show the updated list if needed.
- Add uses the existing add + normalization rules from the legacy Confirm flow:
  - trim whitespace
  - ignore empty
  - preserve existing dedupe behavior (exact string match or whatever legacy does)
  - no schema changes (ingredients remain string[])
- Empty state + guardrails:
  - If ingredients list becomes empty, show a small inline empty-state message (e.g., “Add at least one ingredient to continue.”)
  - Do NOT wire the “Create my recipe” CTA yet unless already wired elsewhere; if it exists, keep it disabled when list is empty.

Constraints:
- Do NOT change preference logic (already wired in Phase 3).
- Do NOT wire allow_extras toggle behavior yet (can remain no-op if Phase 5 will handle it).
- Do NOT change generate/payload logic in this phase.
- Do NOT modify legacy Confirm screen behavior; consolidated screen must reuse existing handlers/state.

Gate via feature flag:
- FRIDGE_SINGLE_RECIPE_SCREEN_V1 = OFF by default.

Proof:
- Flag ON:
  - Ingredients render as list rows (not chips) with subtle background and right-aligned trash icon.
  - Tapping trash removes the ingredient and updates the list immediately.
  - Tapping “+ Add more” expands an inline input row.
  - Adding a non-empty ingredient inserts it using existing normalization/dedupe behavior.
  - Adding empty/whitespace does nothing (and does not insert blank rows).
  - If user removes all ingredients, empty-state message appears and primary CTA (if present) is disabled.
- Flag OFF:
  - Legacy 2-step flow works unchanged.
- Temporary logs (ok to remove later):
  - "single_screen_v1 ingredient_add"
  - "single_screen_v1 ingredient_remove"
