Goal: Fix a **title regression bug** on the persisted remix page so the title format matches the Home page behavior.

This is a **small, targeted UI fix**. No backend changes. No schema changes. No prompt changes.

---

Context:
- The Home page correctly renders remix titles as:
  
    `${extractedTitle || "Recipe"} + ${alternatives.length} Chef tips to make it better`

- The new persisted remix route (`/remix/:pageId`) introduced a regression:
  - `client/src/pages/remix-page.tsx` currently renders **only the base recipe title**
  - This causes saved pages to lose the `"X Chef tips to make it better"` suffix

Root cause:
- When the `/remix/:pageId` route was implemented, the title was reconstructed using only:
  
    `payload.extractedRecipe?.title || data.title`

- The logic that appends `"X Chef tips to make it better"` was not carried over from the Home page.

---

Fix Required:
Update `client/src/pages/remix-page.tsx` so the title is constructed **identically** to the Home page.

Specifically:

Replace the existing title logic (around line ~116):

    title={payload.extractedRecipe?.title || data.title}

With:

    title={`${payload.extractedRecipe?.title || data.title} + ${payload.alternatives?.length || 0} Chef tips to make it better`}

---

Do:
1) Open `client/src/pages/remix-page.tsx`
2) Locate the title prop/render logic for the page header
3) Update it to:
   - Use the extracted recipe title when available
   - Append `" + X Chef tips to make it better"`
   - Derive `X` from `payload.alternatives.length`
   - Default safely to `0` if alternatives is missing
4) Do NOT change:
   - Any backend code
   - Any shared layout components
   - Any Home page logic
   - Any routing behavior

---

Verification:
1) Generate a remix from the Home page:
   - Confirm title shows:  
     `Recipe Name + X Chef tips to make it better`
2) Navigate to the persisted page at `/remix/:pageId`:
   - Confirm the title matches the Home page exactly
3) Refresh `/remix/:pageId`:
   - Confirm the title remains correct
4) Navigate back to Home and generate another remix:
   - Confirm no regressions

---

Proof:
- Persisted remix pages and in-memory remix pages display **identical title formatting**
- App compiles and runs with no other behavior changes
