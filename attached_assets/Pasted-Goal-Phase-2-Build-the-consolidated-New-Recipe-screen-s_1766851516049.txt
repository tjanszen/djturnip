Goal: Phase 2 — Build the consolidated “New Recipe” screen skeleton to match Crumb’s structure (header + tiles region + ingredients section), without wiring any real interactions yet.

Do:
- In the consolidated screen created in Phase 1, implement the full layout skeleton:
  - Header:
    - Back arrow (uses existing navigation goBack)
    - Title: “New Recipe”
  - Top controls region:
    - Render 3 card-like tile placeholders in a row (wrap on small screens):
      - Guests (person icon)
      - Time (clock icon)
      - Cuisine (globe icon)
    - Each tile shows:
      - icon
      - label (Guests/Time/Cuisine)
      - value placeholder text (e.g., “2”, “Best”, “Any”) + chevron icon
    - Tiles are pressable visually, but onPress can be a no-op or temporary console log.
  - Ingredients section:
    - Section header row with title “Ingredients” (left)
    - “+ Add more” button (right) — pressable, but no behavior yet (no-op/log ok)
    - Below, render ingredient rows from the existing ingredient list if easily accessible; otherwise render 3–5 static placeholder rows.
    - Each ingredient row is a full-width rounded container with subtle background and a right-aligned trash icon button (trash onPress no-op/log ok).
  - Toggle row:
    - Render label “Allow other ingredients?” with a toggle control (can be disabled/no-op for now).
    - Optional helper text: “Recipe may include common pantry items”
  - Bottom CTA:
    - Render primary button “Create my recipe” in gold/yellow styling.
    - Button disabled and/or onPress no-op for now.

Constraints:
- Do NOT wire up real state changes yet (no preference setting, no ingredient add/remove, no toggle binding).
- Do NOT call generate or alter payload logic.
- Keep all existing legacy screens/flow unchanged and reachable when flag is OFF.

Gate via feature flag:
- FRIDGE_SINGLE_RECIPE_SCREEN_V1 = OFF by default.

Proof:
- With flag ON, screen renders with:
  - Back arrow + “New Recipe” header
  - 3 card tiles w icons + chevron
  - Ingredients header + “+ Add more” button
  - Ingredient rows styled as list rows w trash icon
  - “Allow other ingredients?” toggle row
  - “Create my recipe” CTA styled and present (no-op)
- With flag OFF, existing 2-step flow still works unchanged.
- Logs (or console) show taps on tiles/add more/trash (temporary) but no state/payload changes occur.
