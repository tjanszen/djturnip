Goal: Implement **Phase 5** of persisted remix pages per `docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/persisted_page_urls.md`.

Phase 5 focuses on **Library UX polish** (scanability + small usability improvements) without changing the persistence model or routes (Phases 1–4 are already complete).

Do NOT change backend schemas or write paths in this phase. Avoid scope creep into pruning (Phase 6).

---

Do:
1) Review the current Library implementation:
   - `client/src/pages/library.tsx`
   - Confirm it uses `GET /api/remix-pages?limit&offset` and renders `items[]`.

2) Improve scanability and basic UX:
   - Ensure each library item/card displays:
     - **Title**
     - **Created date** (human-readable)
     - Subtitle: **“Generated from: domain.com”** (use `sourceDomain`; if missing, show “Generated from: unknown source” or omit subtitle)
   - Make the entire row/card clickable (not just a small link) to improve usability.
   - Add a small visual affordance (chevron/arrow) indicating navigation to the page (optional, but recommended).

3) Library empty state + first-action guidance:
   - If `items.length === 0`, show:
     - “No pages yet — remix a recipe to get started.”
     - A primary button: “Remix a recipe” that navigates back to Home (or focuses the URL input if that’s easy).

4) Pagination behavior:
   - Keep the existing “Load More” button.
   - Add a loading/disabled state to the “Load More” button while fetching.
   - Hide/disable “Load More” when there are no more results:
     - Use `total` from the API response to determine if `offset + limit >= total`
     - If `total` is missing for any reason, fallback to: hide “Load More” when the last fetch returned fewer than `limit` items.

5) Add a minimal “View Library” entry point (if not already present):
   - Add a link/button on Home (URL input screen) to navigate to `/library`
   - Keep this subtle (secondary action) so it doesn’t distract from Remix.

6) Confirm navigation correctness:
   - Clicking an item routes to `/remix/:pageId`
   - Browser back returns to the library list where the user left off (offset preserved if you store it in component state)
   - No regressions to existing flows (Fridge Cleanout, etc.)

Out of Scope:
- Search/filter by domain (defer; can add later)
- Any change to DB schema
- Pruning/retention policy (Phase 6)
- Auth/user accounts

---

Verification:
1) With at least 2 saved pages in DB:
   - Visit `/library`
   - Confirm each item shows title, human-readable date, and “Generated from: domain.com”
   - Click an item -> loads `/remix/:pageId`
   - Browser back returns to `/library` with list intact

2) Empty state:
   - If DB is empty, `/library` shows the empty message + “Remix a recipe” button
   - Clicking button returns to Home

3) Pagination:
   - Click “Load More” repeatedly until exhausted
   - Confirm button disables while loading
   - Confirm “Load More” hides/disables when no more items (based on total or short page)

Proof:
- Library is more readable and navigable without changing backend behavior.
- App compiles and runs; existing flows continue to work.
