Goal: Fix back-navigation so that when FRIDGE_SINGLE_RECIPE_SCREEN_V1 is ON, both the top-left back arrow and the “Edit Ingredients” CTA return to the new consolidated “New Recipe” screen (not the legacy 2-step flow).

Do:
- Identify the Recipe Result screen (the screen showing recipe title, summary, ingredients, steps, and bottom buttons “Edit Ingredients” + “Generate Again”).
- Update navigation behavior ONLY when FRIDGE_SINGLE_RECIPE_SCREEN_V1 is ON:
  - Top-left back arrow:
    - Do NOT rely on default stack back if it lands in legacy flow.
    - Instead, navigate explicitly to the consolidated “New Recipe” screen route (the Phase 1/2/3 screen).
    - Prefer preserving session state (ingredients + prefs + allow_other_ingredients) so the user sees their last inputs.
  - “Edit Ingredients” CTA:
    - Route explicitly to the consolidated “New Recipe” screen route (same as above).
    - If the consolidated screen supports focusing the ingredients section, pass a param like focus="ingredients" (optional).
- Ensure this does not break legacy behavior:
  - When FRIDGE_SINGLE_RECIPE_SCREEN_V1 is OFF, keep current back behavior unchanged (it can return to old flow).
- Make the navigation robust:
  - If the consolidated screen is already in the stack, prefer popping back to it (popTo / popToTop / reset to that route) rather than pushing duplicates.
  - If it is not in the stack (edge cases like deep links), perform a safe reset to a minimal stack:
    - [ConsolidatedNewRecipeScreen, RecipeResultScreen] or just navigate to ConsolidatedNewRecipeScreen.
- Add minimal logs to confirm behavior:
  - On header back when flag ON: "single_screen_v1 back_to_new_recipe"
  - On Edit Ingredients when flag ON: "single_screen_v1 edit_to_new_recipe"

Constraints:
- Do NOT change generation logic, payloads, or screen UI rendering besides navigation targets.
- Do NOT remove or refactor the legacy flow; this is a routing fix only.
- Keep FRIDGE_SINGLE_RECIPE_SCREEN_V1 gating intact (OFF by default).

Proof:
- With FRIDGE_SINGLE_RECIPE_SCREEN_V1 ON:
  - From the Recipe Result screen, tapping the top-left back arrow returns to the consolidated “New Recipe” screen (not legacy Preferences/Confirm).
  - Tapping “Edit Ingredients” returns to the consolidated “New Recipe” screen (optionally focused on ingredients).
  - The consolidated screen shows the same current session values (ingredients/prefs/toggle) as used to generate the recipe.
- With FRIDGE_SINGLE_RECIPE_SCREEN_V1 OFF:
  - Back arrow and Edit Ingredients behave exactly as before.
- Logs include:
  - "single_screen_v1 back_to_new_recipe"
  - "single_screen_v1 edit_to_new_recipe"
