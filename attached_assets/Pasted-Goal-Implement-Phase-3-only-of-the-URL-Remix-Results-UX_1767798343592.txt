Goal: Implement **Phase 3 only** of the URL Remix Results UX refactor, as defined in  
`docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/remix_result_layout.md`.

Phase 3 replaces the current URL Remix “swipe” UX with a **read-only Fridge Cleanout–style results view** using the shared layout extracted in Phase 2. This phase must preserve the same route behavior: user pastes URL → clicks Remix → content is replaced with results (no navigation).

---

Do:
1) Read and understand the implementation plan at:
   - `docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/remix_result_layout.md`
   Focus specifically on:
   - “Phase 3 — Ingredients Section (Read-Only, List-First)”
   - “Phase 4 — Remix Section (Editorial Cards)”
   - The UX intent: calm, editorial, non-interactive, spacing/typography-driven hierarchy

2) Wire URL Remix success state to render the shared results layout
   - In the URL Remix screen/route, after a successful `/api/recipes/process` response, render the shared `RecipeResultsLayout` (or the shared component you extracted in Phase 2) instead of the existing swipe UI.
   - Provide it the URL Remix data:
     - `title` from `extractedRecipe.title`
     - `ingredients` from `extractedRecipe.ingredients` (raw strings are fine)
     - `remixCards` from `alternatives[]` (9 total, ordered)
   - Ensure this happens on the SAME route (replace content as it does today).

3) Implement **read-only mode** for URL Remix results
   - Add/enable a `mode="readOnly"` (or equivalent prop) when rendering `RecipeResultsLayout` for URL Remix.
   - Read-only requirements:
     A) Ingredients list:
        - No chevrons
        - No dropdowns
        - No swap/substitute UI
        - No tap/click handlers on ingredient rows
     B) Remix cards:
        - Render cards in the same visual format as Fridge Cleanout remix cards
        - Cards are presentational only:
          - no swipe
          - no click/select
          - no hover affordances that imply interaction
        - Each card should show:
          - the card `title`
          - the `changes[]` list (action + details)

4) Preserve ordering and content density
   - Render all 9 cards in a vertical stack (scrolling is expected).
   - Preserve backend order (Basics first, then Delights).
   - Do NOT add Basic/Delight labels or sections in the UI for now.

5) Remove legacy URL Remix results UI elements in the success state
   - In the URL Remix success/results state only, ensure the following are NOT rendered:
     - swipe controls / swipe deck UI
     - “Skip or save this recipe”
     - “Generate Again”
     - “Let’s Cook!” CTA
   - Keep the URL input form visible only in the pre-results state (or whatever the app does today), but the success state should be the new results layout.

6) Error behavior remains unchanged in this phase
   - Keep inline errors near the input (Phase 4 will refine loading/error polish if needed).
   - Do not add skeleton loaders or spinners here.

Out of Scope for Phase 3:
- Loading state changes (handled in Phase 5 per plan, if applicable)
- Backend changes (Phase 1 already provided ingredients)
- Adding any new navigation links (“Try another recipe”)
- Sticky headers, advanced scrolling UX
- Remix selection or cooking CTA behavior

---

Gate via feature flag: Keep existing gating behavior as-is (e.g., ALT_RECIPES_V2 stays off by default). This phase should not change flag defaults.

Proof:
- With `ALT_RECIPES_V2=on`, a valid recipe URL produces a results screen that matches Fridge Cleanout structure:
  - Recipe title at top
  - Ingredients list rendered read-only (no chevrons/dropdowns/clicks)
  - Remix section renders all 9 cards with title + changes list
- No swipe UI, no Skip/Save, no Generate Again, no Let’s Cook CTA in the results state.
- URL Remix still uses the same route; content is replaced after generation.
- Fridge Cleanout flow remains unchanged (interactive mode still works).
