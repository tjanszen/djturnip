Goal: Diagnose and fix a **title formatting bug** on the Remix results pages where the title renders as:
  "Recipe + 9 Chef tips to make it better"
instead of:
  "[Name of recipe] + [number of remixes/variations] Chef tips to make it better"

This prompt is for **investigation + root cause + fix**. Keep the change minimal and safe.

---

Context
Expected title format:
  `${recipeName} + ${variationCount} Chef tips to make it better`

Observed bug:
- Title shows `Recipe + 9 Chef tips to make it better`
- That indicates `recipeName` is falling back to `"Recipe"` (or `"Recipe"` default) even though the extracted recipe title should be available.

Known implementation detail:
- Home page uses something like:
  `extractedTitle || "Recipe"`
- Remix page (/remix/:pageId) should build the same title from persisted payload:
  `payload.extractedRecipe?.title || data.title`

But the persisted page still ends up with `"Recipe"` sometimes.

---

Do (Diagnosis)
1) Reproduce the bug end-to-end:
   - Generate a remix from a real recipe URL
   - Navigate to `/remix/:pageId`
   - Observe the title rendering as "Recipe + X Chef tips to make it better"

2) Identify the **exact data source** used for the title in both views:
   - Home in-memory results (likely `home.tsx`)
   - Persisted page route (`client/src/pages/remix-page.tsx`)

3) Inspect the network response for:
   - `POST /api/recipes/process`
   - `GET /api/remix-pages/:pageId`
   Specifically verify whether the title exists at:
   - `payload.extractedRecipe.title`
   - `payload.extractedRecipe?.title`
   - `data.title` (top-level metadata from DB fetch)
   - any other field like `payload.title` or `payload.extractedRecipe?.name`

4) Confirm whether the persisted payload stored in DB includes a title at all:
   - Query the DB for a known `pageId` and inspect:
     - `title` column
     - `payload->'extractedRecipe'->>'title'`
     - `payload->>'extractedRecipe'` shape
   Goal: determine if the missing title is:
   - a frontend field-path issue, OR
   - a backend persistence issue (wrong title stored), OR
   - an extraction issue (title missing sometimes), OR
   - a mismatch between in-memory payload vs persisted payload shape.

---

Expected Root Cause Patterns (pick the actual one after inspection)
A) **Field path mismatch**: persisted payload uses `extractedRecipe.name` or `payload.title`, not `extractedRecipe.title`
B) **DB fetch shape mismatch**: `remix-page.tsx` is reading `payload` from the wrong layer (e.g., `data.payload.payload`)
C) **Backend saved wrong title**: DB `title` column is empty or set to "Recipe"
D) **Extractor sometimes returns blank title** and Home compensates differently than persisted page

---

Fix Requirements
1) Make the title rendering robust and consistent across both pages:
   - Use the best available title in priority order:
     1) `payload.extractedRecipe?.title`
     2) `payload.title` (if it exists)
     3) `data.title` (DB column)
     4) `"Recipe"` fallback

2) Ensure the variation count uses the actual alternatives length:
   - `payload.alternatives?.length ?? 0`

3) Keep the final display format identical everywhere:
   - `${resolvedTitle} + ${variationCount} Chef tips to make it better`

4) If the bug is backend-side (title not stored correctly):
   - Fix DB insert logic in `server/routes.ts` (Phase 2 persistence path) to store:
     - `title = validatedPayload.extractedRecipe.title` (or correct field)
   - AND keep the frontend fix as a defensive fallback.

---

Deliverables
- A short root cause write-up in code comments or PR description:
  - what was wrong
  - how you verified it
  - why the fix works
- Minimal code change(s) in:
  - `client/src/pages/remix-page.tsx` (almost certainly)
  - plus backend `server/routes.ts` only if DB is storing the wrong title

---

Verification (pass/fail)
1) Generate remix from a known recipe URL where extracted title is non-empty.
2) Confirm Home results title shows:
   - `"<Actual Recipe Title> + X Chef tips to make it better"`
3) Navigate to `/remix/:pageId`:
   - Title matches Home exactly (same recipe title, same count)
4) Refresh `/remix/:pageId`:
   - Title remains correct (proves it comes from persisted data)
5) Try a URL that fails to extract title (if any):
   - Title should gracefully fallback to:
     - `"Recipe + X Chef tips to make it better"`
   - This fallback should be rare and expected only for extraction failures.

Proof:
- Persisted remix pages consistently show the actual recipe name in the title when it exists in either the stored payload or DB metadata.
- No regressions to Fridge Cleanout or other flows.
