Goal: Phase 3 — Add ingredient substitution UX to the Recipe Summary screen using a bottom sheet, powered by RecipeDTO V2 substitutes, without affecting generation or navigation.

Do:
- Confirm feature flag RECIPE_DETAIL_V2 is enabled for this path and OFF by default.
- In the Recipe Summary screen (from Phase 2), update the Ingredients list to support conditional interaction:
  - For each IngredientItem:
    - If substitutes.length > 0:
      - Render the row as tappable.
      - Show a chevron or affordance indicating it can be swapped.
    - If substitutes.length === 0:
      - Render the row as non-tappable.
      - Do NOT show a chevron or tap affordance.
- On tapping a tappable ingredient row:
  - Open a bottom sheet (preferred mobile pattern).
  - Bottom sheet content:
    - Header:
      - Ingredient name
      - Ingredient amount (if present)
    - Body:
      - Radio list of substitution options derived from IngredientItem.substitutes.
      - Include the original ingredient as a selectable option (to allow reverting).
    - Footer:
      - Primary CTA: “Swap”
      - Secondary: “Cancel” (or tap outside to dismiss)
- Swapping behavior:
  - Maintain a local “working copy” of ingredients for the Recipe Summary screen.
  - On Swap:
    - Update the working copy with the selected substitute’s name + amount.
    - Preserve the original IngredientItem.id (do NOT change IDs).
    - Close the bottom sheet.
  - Ensure original RecipeDTO remains unchanged in memory.
- Revert behavior:
  - Selecting the original ingredient option restores original name + amount.
- Generate Again behavior:
  - Must ignore any substitutions.
  - Must use the original ingredient list (not the working copy).
- Visual polish:
  - After a swap, the ingredient row immediately reflects the new name + amount.
  - No toast required; visual update is sufficient.

Constraints:
- Do NOT trigger regeneration or backend calls when swapping ingredients.
- Do NOT modify RecipeDTO V2 schema.
- Do NOT allow editing ingredient text or amounts directly.
- Do NOT expose substitutions in Cook Mode yet (that is Phase 4).
- Keep legacy behavior unchanged when RECIPE_DETAIL_V2 is OFF.

Gate via feature flag:
- RECIPE_DETAIL_V2 = OFF by default.

Proof:
- With RECIPE_DETAIL_V2 ON:
  - Ingredient rows with substitutes show a chevron and open a bottom sheet on tap.
  - Ingredient rows without substitutes are visibly non-interactive.
  - Selecting a substitute updates the ingredient name + amount in the list.
  - Re-opening the sheet allows reverting to the original ingredient.
  - “Generate again” regenerates using the original ingredients (not substituted).
- With RECIPE_DETAIL_V2 OFF:
  - Legacy recipe result screen works unchanged.
- No generation calls, payload changes, or navigation changes occur during swaps.
