Goal: Update the Recipe Detail Page ("fridge-result" view) UX/UI to a clean, full-width layout (no centered card), with new section order and simplified bottom actions — while keeping the Ingredients section fully interactive as it is today.

Do:
- Locate the Recipe Detail Page component/view ("fridge-result") and update the layout to remove the current card/container styling:
  - Remove bg-card/border/shadow/rounded-2xl “card in the middle” look.
  - Remove max-w centered container behavior.
  - Use a full-width, mobile-first vertical layout with minimal horizontal padding only for text sections (hero image should be edge-to-edge or near edge-to-edge).

- Update visual hierarchy and section order to exactly:
  1) Hero Image (top)
  2) Metadata row: Servings | Time | Calories (if present)
  3) Short Description (recipe.description)
  4) Ingredients section (UNCHANGED behavior)
  5) Primary CTA: “Let’s Cook!”
  6) Secondary CTA: “Remix Recipe” (replaces “Generate again”)

- Header:
  - Keep back arrow in upper-left (ghost/icon-only) with existing testid: data-testid="button-result-back"
  - Remove any trash/delete icon in upper-right (do not render it).
  - Keep title/description readable (retain existing data-testid="text-recipe-name" and data-testid="text-recipe-summary").

- Hero Image:
  - Keep existing async image generation via POST /api/recipes/generate-image and existing client-side caching by recipe hash.
  - Change aspect ratio from aspect-square to a clean full-width hero ratio:
    - Use 4:3 (preferred) or 16:9; choose one and apply consistently.
  - Keep object-cover.

- Metadata row:
  - Keep the 3 badges (servings, time, calories optional) under the image.
  - Ensure full-width and wraps on small screens.

- Remove “Why this works” from UI:
  - Do NOT render the explanation section at all.
  - Keep the `explanation` field in JSON unchanged.

- Ingredients section:
  - DO NOT change this section’s UI or behavior.
  - Keep ingredient interactivity exactly as it exists today:
    - chevrons, tappable rows, substitution drawer, working copy state, etc.
  - Ensure layout changes do not break ingredient interactions.

- Action buttons:
  - Keep “Let’s Cook!” as primary (existing data-testid="button-lets-cook") and keep navigation to Cook Mode unchanged.
  - Replace “Generate again” button text with “Remix Recipe”:
    - Keep same behavior: trigger a new recipe generation with the same inputs as today.
    - Keep existing testid if tests rely on it, otherwise update to data-testid="button-remix-recipe" and update any tests accordingly.
    - Telemetry: rename event generate_again_click -> remix_recipe_click only if telemetry changes are low-risk; otherwise keep event name and change only label.
  - Remove ONLY the bottom hypertext link “Edit Ingredients” entirely (do not render it).
    - Do not change ingredient editing/substitution mechanics inside the Ingredients section.

- Keep all other behavior unchanged:
  - Recipe generation flow
  - Cuisine logic
  - DTO fields and parsing
  - Cook mode screen

Do NOT:
- Add new feature flags
- Change backend schemas/prompts
- Remove ingredient substitution drawer/working copy logic
- Add new endpoints
- Rework image generation integration beyond aspect ratio/layout

Proof:
- Logs must still include: "recipe_image_gen_success recipeKey=<hash>" when image loads.
- Back button works and returns to ingredient input screen.
- Recipe detail page shows: Image → badges → description → ingredients (interactive) → Let’s Cook → Remix Recipe.
- “Why this works” is not visible anywhere on the page.
- Ingredients remain tappable and substitution drawer still works exactly as before.
- “Edit Ingredients” link is not visible anywhere.
- “Remix Recipe” triggers a new recipe + new hero image generation (new recipeKey) without crashing.
