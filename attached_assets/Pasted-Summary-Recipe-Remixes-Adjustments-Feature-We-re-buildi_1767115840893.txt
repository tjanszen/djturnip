Summary: Recipe Remixes / Adjustments Feature

We’re building a “Remix this recipe” feature on the Recipe Detail Page that gives users 3–4 smart, in-context adjustments to an AI-generated recipe (inspired by Tasty), without regenerating the entire recipe in real time.

What this is

Each recipe will include pre-generated remix options returned as part of the recipe JSON.

Remixes are small, intent-preserving changes (e.g. “Extra saucy”, “Herb it up”, “Mash the potatoes”) that:

Keep the core identity of the dish

Adjust only 1 axis (texture, flavor emphasis, or technique)

Touch at most 2–3 ingredients/steps

Remixes are applied instantly in the UI (ingredients + steps update), with an Undo option.

Only one remix active at a time (no stacking yet).

What this is NOT

Not free-form user prompting

Not a full recipe regeneration

Not dietary transformations (vegan, keto, etc.)

Not a social/community feature (yet)

AI behavior

Recipe generation will also generate 3–4 remix objects alongside the base recipe.

Pantry staples (oil, vinegar, soy sauce, spices, etc.) can be assumed and do not count toward the 2–3 new ingredient limit.

Remixes may add up to 2–3 new ingredients max.

Recipe name never changes.

Core ingredients are never removed (except optional/garnish-level).

Time/calories may update only when obviously affected.

Data & State

Remixes live on the recipe object (V2 schema).

Base recipe remains immutable.

UI applies a remix as a reversible patch (Undo restores base recipe).

“Generate Again” always regenerates from the base recipe.

UX

“Remix this recipe” section appears below Ingredients.

Each remix is shown as a tappable card with a short explanation.

Applying a remix updates Ingredients + Cook Mode steps.

No real-time AI calls when tapping a remix.

Telemetry

We want basic events:

recipe_remixes_shown

recipe_remix_applied

recipe_remix_undone

Why we’re doing this

Give users a delightful, low-effort way to personalize recipes

Keep latency low and UX predictable

Avoid vague user input while still feeling “smart and custom”
