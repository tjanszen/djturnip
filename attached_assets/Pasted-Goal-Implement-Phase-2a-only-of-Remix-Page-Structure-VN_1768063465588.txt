Goal: Implement **Phase 2a only** of Remix Page Structure VNext, per  
`docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/remix_page_1_10_26.md`.

Phase 2a updates the **URL Remix V2 prompt generation** so the model outputs the newly-required fields added in Phase 1:
- top-level `what_is_this`
- top-level `why_this_works`
- per-alternative `why_this_works` (1 sentence max, mechanism-based)

This phase should be testable via the API (`POST /api/recipes/process`) and should not include frontend/layout changes.

Do:
1) Read the implementation plan:
   - `docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/remix_page_1_10_26.md`
   Focus on:
   - Phase 2a prompt updates
   - Requirement: per-variation `why_this_works` should be written BEFORE `changes[]` in the JSON schema description.

2) Update the V2 prompt template to generate the new fields in the same single LLM call.
   - File: `server/prompts/urlRemixV2.ts` (or the current V2 prompt module)
   - Update the SYSTEM prompt to require EXACT JSON with:
     - `what_is_this`: 1–2 sentences max, spark-notes definition of the dish (answer “what is this / am I in the right place?”)
     - `why_this_works`: 1–2 sentences max, base mechanism explanation (balance, browning, acid, spice, fat, texture, etc.)
     - `alternatives`: EXACTLY 9 items total (5 basic + 4 delight)
       Each alternative MUST include these fields in this order:
         - `kind`: "basic" | "delight"
         - `title`: short (4–7 words)
         - `why_this_works`: EXACTLY 1 sentence max, must reference a concrete mechanism (e.g., acid cuts richness; browning builds umami; herbs lift heavy mayo; sweetness balances heat; crunchy contrast improves texture)
         - `changes`: EXACTLY 2 or 3 items, each with:
           - `action`: 2–5 words
           - `details`: MUST be specific and pass the existing specificity guardrail (include a number/unit/time/temp)

   - IMPORTANT: Make it explicit that the model should not invent that the base recipe contains ingredients it doesn’t list; it should be grounded in the extracted ingredients + instructions provided.

3) Update the V2 USER message template to include extracted recipe content as grounding input (keep as you do today):
   - title
   - ingredients list
   - instructions list
   - Do NOT include style focus (style is currently unused).

4) Keep existing strictness constraints so Phase 1 validation passes:
   - Return only valid JSON
   - No duplicate titles
   - Keep dish identity recognizable
   - Ensure `details` strings include at least one of:
     - number token (e.g., 1, 2, 1/2, ¼) OR
     - units (tsp/tbsp/cup/oz/g) OR
     - time/temp (minute/min/°F/°C)
   - Maintain 5 basic + 4 delight.

5) Update any TypeScript types used by the prompt response parser (if needed) so it expects:
   - `what_is_this`
   - `why_this_works`
   - `alternative.why_this_works`

6) Verify via API:
   - With `ALT_RECIPES_V2=on`, call `/api/recipes/process` with 2 known recipe URLs (e.g., AllRecipes cookies, Serious Eats bolognese).
   - Confirm V2 returns 200 without falling back to V1.
   - Confirm payload includes the new required fields and passes Zod validation.
   - Confirm per-alternative `why_this_works` appears before `changes[]` in the JSON output (field ordering).

Out of Scope:
- No frontend work
- No viewState changes
- No layout changes
- No additional schema changes (Phase 1 already done)
- No persistence / routing changes

Proof:
- Logs show V2 path succeeds without fallback for known URLs.
- Response includes non-empty `what_is_this` and `why_this_works`.
- Each of the 9 alternatives includes `why_this_works` (1 sentence max) AND `changes[]` (2–3) with specific details.
- Zod validation passes on attempt 1 for most runs (retry rate remains low).
