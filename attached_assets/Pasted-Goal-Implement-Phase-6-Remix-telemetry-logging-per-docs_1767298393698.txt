Goal:
Implement Phase 6 — Remix telemetry logging, per:
docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/recipe-remixes.md (Phase 6: Telemetry).

Context:
- This is V2-only.
- Remixes are pre-generated and non-stackable.
- `generatedRecipe` is immutable and represents the base recipe.
- `remixedRecipe` is a derived variant when a remix is active.
- `activeRemixId` tracks the currently applied remix (or null).
- `recipeKey` must remain the BASE recipe key at all times.
- Telemetry uses console.log() strings only (no analytics SDK).
- Phase 5 is complete: Cook Mode consumes remixed steps when active.

Do:
1) Add telemetry when remix cards are first rendered:
   - Fire once per recipe load.
   - Log:
     console.log("recipe_v2 remixes_shown recipeKey=<key> count=<n>");
2) Add telemetry when a remix is applied:
   - Fire when user applies a remix.
   - Log:
     console.log("recipe_v2 remix_applied recipeKey=<key> remixId=<id>");
3) Add telemetry when a remix is undone:
   - Fire when user taps Undo.
   - Log:
     console.log("recipe_v2 remix_undone recipeKey=<key> remixId=<id>");
4) Add telemetry when Cook Mode starts with a remix active (optional but recommended):
   - Fire once on entering Cook Mode if `activeRemixId !== null`.
   - Log:
     console.log("recipe_v2 remix_cook_started recipeKey=<key> remixId=<id>");
5) Ensure all telemetry:
   - Uses the BASE `recipeKey` (not derived or remixed variants)
   - Fires once per user action (no duplicate logs on re-render)
   - Does not block UI or introduce side effects

Do NOT:
- Introduce a telemetry utility or SDK
- Change recipeKey computation
- Add persistence
- Add feature flags
- Log full recipe payloads

Gate via feature flag:
None (per implementation plan).

Proof:
- `remixes_shown` fires once when remix cards are visible.
- `remix_applied` fires exactly once per apply action.
- `remix_undone` fires exactly once per undo action.
- `remix_cook_started` fires only when entering Cook Mode with a remix active.
- All logs include the BASE recipeKey and correct remixId.
- No duplicate logs caused by re-renders.

Verification:
- Manually apply and undo multiple remixes.
- Navigate into and out of Cook Mode.
- Confirm console output matches expected events and counts.
